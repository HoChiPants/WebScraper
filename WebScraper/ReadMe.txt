Comments to Evaluators: The nested try's were on purpose.

Time Out Value - I chose the value of 7. I did this because if you wanted a ton of data from a website like this scraper does, you should have fast
enough internet to keep up with it and be choosing websites that are built correctly. Longer wait time could mean that you are waiting much longer for
websites than you want and anything shorter isn't probable for a website. I believe that 7 is a good value to allow the person to no wait a super long
time for the values to return. The effects that it caused where when selenium couldn't find the value on the page it was looking for it just topped for
a couple of seconds at a standstill. When this happens it made me think the program was broken but it was just looking and not
finding what it wanted.

Selenium was a really interesting thing to see. I liked how it structures itself and how easy it is to manage and use it. I liked how you can find things
in different ways like Xpath, ID, or other ways. I also liked how you could wait until things were loaded because sometimes the page takes a couple of 
seconds to load. The hard thing about Selenium was the debugging of the website. I wish it would highlight on the webpage what it was doing because it made
it hard to make sure it was looking at the right things. 

I feel like using Selenium on my LOT projects would be easier because there aren't as many divs and intense data paths to follow and wait for. Timing 
especially would be much faster because there isn't as much that is being loaded on the webpage. Since there isn't much dynamic loading, it would immediately
start to find and do the tasks it was presented on the webpage. Some hard things, however, could be the fact that my id's for certain elements could 
be common, meaning not unique. I'm not sure what Selenium does if you search for id and it exists on the same page twice. That could be a problem.
